# Objective of this mini project
- [x] Visualize data
- [ ] Augmentation image dataset
- [x] Apply object classification on blood cell dataset
- [x] Apply object detection on blood cell dataset

## Yolov5s
- Training using Google colab instead of local machine. So the train notebook in this repo only a copy
- Data is not augmented yet
- input 640x640, 16 batch, 50 epoch, T4 GPU

## Note (01/05/2025)
- The dataset will not be uploaded
- Should I augmented the whole set or just train set? No, they are meant to be fixed for consistent evaluation
- Try to train a model without data augmentation first then a version with augmented data
- Might use Yolov5s, SSD300 and FRCNN
